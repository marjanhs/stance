This limit is measured as the amount of radiation absorbed by a user and is known as the specific absorption rate (SAR). In 1996 the SAR for cell phone radiation was set at a maximum of 1.6 watts of energy absorbed per kilogram of body weight. Manufactures of cell phones must test their products to ensure that they meet this standard. Random tests of phones on the market by FCC scientists further ensure that radiation levels meet FCC guidelines. 

D:\marjan\data\procon\with_context_aaai\golf\arguments/con2_argument.txt,0,"Golf in the United States is a $70 billion annual industry with 24.1 million players.   A 2016 poll by Public Policy Polling found that nineteen percent of Americans call themselves golf fans, down from twenty-three percent in 2015.   The debate over whether or not golf is a sport wages on the internet, in bars, amongst sportswriters, and even on the golf course.  Proponents say that golf meets the definition of ""sport"" found in the dictionary, requires physical exertion and coordination, and is recognized as a sport by sporting goods companies, athletic associations, fans, the media, and more. They point to golf's inclusion in the Olympics starting in 2016 as further evidence of its qualification as a sport.  Opponents say that golf better meets the definition of ""game"" than ""sport,"" does not require rigorous physical activity, and can be played professionally by people who are overweight, injured, or non-athletic. They argue that golf is a game or leisure activity, and they cite golf's 112-year absence from the Olympics as proof that it is not a sport.  Early History of Golf   The origins of golf remain somewhat murky because several countries invented games that involved hitting a ball with a club at a target. The 11th century French game ""palle- mail"" or ""jeu de mail,"" and the 13th century Dutch game ""kolven"" are arguably predecessors to golf.  A claim has even been made that the Chinese recorded a description of the game in a text written during the Song Dynasty (960 -1279 AD).   The invention of golf as we know it today, with the crucial aspect of hitting a ball into a hole, is generally credited to Scotland in the 1300s.  Historians say that golf was played at St. Andrews in Scotland even before the university was founded in 1411.   In the Middle Ages, the Scots were so captivated by golf that King James II feared it was interfering with the archery practice needed to help protect Scotland against the English.  On Mar. 6, 1457, the Scottish Parliament banned golf with a decree that read, ""...[I]t is ordained and the decreed that the lords and barons both spiritual and temporal should organise archery displays four times in the year. And that football and golf should be utterly condemned and stopped... [W]e ordain that [those found playing these games] be punished by the local barons and, failing them, by the King's officers.""  The ban was lifted in 1502 when the Treaty of Glasgow temporarily ended the wars between Scotland and England. King James IV made the first recorded purchase of golf equipment in that same year and became an avid golfer.    St. Andrews, the home of the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews (R&A), originated the 18-hole golf course in 1764 when golfers felt that some of the holes on the then-22-hole course should be consolidated. To this day, 18 holes remains the standard for a round of golf.   In 1897, the R&A was recognized by existing golf organizations as having the authority to determine the rules of golf.  According to the official rulebook: ""The Game of Golf consists of playing a ball with a club from the teeing ground into the hole by a stroke or successive strokes in accordance with the Rules.""  The first golf club in America was St. Andrews Golf Course in Yonkers, NY, built in 1888.  The Amateur Golf Association of the United States (now called United States Golf Association, or USGA) was formed on Dec. 22, 1894.   Definition of Sport   The question of whether golf is a sport hinges on the definition of ""sport."" The Merriam- Webster dictionary defines sport as ""physical activity engaged in for pleasure; a particular activity (as an athletic game) so engaged in.""  Dictionary.com defines it as ""an athletic activity requiring skill or physical prowess and often of a competitive nature, as racing, baseball, tennis, golf, bowling, wrestling, boxing, hunting, fishing, etc.""   John C. Phillips, Professor of Sociology at the University of the Pacific, asserted that people have an instinctual idea about what ""sport"" means: ""[I]n one sense the word sport need not be analyzed. Anyone who speaks English knows what sport is and is not.""  The topic has nonetheless been subject to significant analysis. A Google search for ""definition of sport"" produces more than 200,000 results.   Sports philosopher Bernard Suits named four elements that distinguish sports from games. ""First, it is a game of skill, which marks it off from games of chance... Second, it is a game of physical skill... Third, a sport is a game that has a wide following... Fourth, and last, a sport is a game that has achieved institutional stability...""    Sociologists Tim Delaney and Tim Madigan defined sport as ""institutionalized, structured, and sanctioned competitive activity beyond the realm of play that involves physical exertion and the use of relatively complex athletic skills.""   Lincoln Allison, Founding Director of the Centre for the Study of Sport in Society at Warwick University, noted that the definition has shifted over time. ""In English, the primary meaning of the word 'sport' changed dramatically in the period after 1880. Before that date, if you picked up a book on sport... it would certainly have been about some combination of hunting, shooting or fishing..."" According to Allison, the modern concept of sport began to solidify around 1930. ""And yet, for all that sport can mean... the core of what people understand by sport in its serious and interesting sense can be defined briefly: sport is the institutionalisation of skill and prowess.""

Martin (2001), the justices ruled 7-2 that the pro tour had to allow a golfer with a disability to use a golf cart because it would not ""fundamentally alter the nature"" of the activity.

D:\marjan\data\procon\with_context_aaai\teachertenure\arguments/con14_argument.txt,0,"Teacher tenure is the increasingly controversial form of job protection that public school teachers in 46 states receive after 1-5 years on the job.  An estimated 2.3 million teachers have tenure.    Proponents of tenure argue that it protects teachers from being fired for personal or political reasons, and prevents the firing of experienced teachers to hire less expensive new teachers. They contend that since school administrators grant tenure, neither teachers nor teacher unions should be unfairly blamed for problems with the tenure system.   Opponents of tenure argue that this job protection makes the removal of poorly performing teachers so difficult and costly that most schools end up retaining their bad teachers. They contend that tenure encourages complacency among teachers who do not fear losing their jobs, and that tenure is no longer needed given current laws against job discrimination.   Prior to the introduction of teacher tenure, teachers were often fired for non-work related reasons. Teachers could be dismissed if a new political party took power or if a principal wanted to give jobs to his friends. Calls for special protections for teachers coincided with the womens suffrage movement and labor struggles during the late 19th century. The National Education Association issued a report in 1885 advocating for public school teachers to receive tenure to protect against political favoritism and discrimination based on gender and race. In 1886, Massachusetts became the first state to pass a pre-college tenure law.  When nearly 10,000 teachers arrived in Chicago for the 1887 NEA conference, teacher tenure was one of the main discussion topics. In 1909, New Jersey passed the first comprehensive K-12 tenure lawin the US. Proponents of the teacher tenure law in New Jersey argued that it would attract more qualified teachers and eliminate political favoritism, while opponents warned that tenure would make it more difficult to remove ineffective teachers.    After the Great Depression, teachers began to organize politically in order to receive funding and job protections.  Teachers unions negotiated for tenure clauses in their contracts with state and individual school districts. By 1940, 70% of K-12 public school teachers had job protections. In the mid-1950s, the number grew to over 80%.    Education and tenure reform became a national issue following the release of A Nation at Risk, a 1983 report of President Ronald Reagans National Commission on Excellence in Education that found ""the educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a Nation and a people.""  The report prompted states to look at reforming tenure, strengthening educational standards, and increasing the use of standardized tests.  Following the release of a 1985 report by the Illinois State Board of Education showing that only three tenured teachers were dismissed on average per year, the Illinois legislature changed their tenure laws to make it easier to dismiss under-performing teachers.  In the 18 years following these changes, only 39 tenured teachers were dismissed.    In 2000, Georgia Governor Roy Barnes, a Democrat, successfully pushed a law through the legislature eliminating tenure for new teachers. Barnes told a joint session of the General Assembly, ""Most of the time, tenure means a principal doesn't even try to dismiss a bad teacher because, even if the principal bucks the odds and succeeds, the cost in time and money is staggering.  When Barnes was up for reelection in 2002, teachers refused to support him, helping Sonny Perdue to become the first Republican Governor of Georgia since 1872.   California Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger took the issue of teacher tenure directly to the voters in a Nov. 8, 2005 special election. Proposition 74 called for the period of time before a teacher becomes tenured to be extended from two years to five years. In response, the California Teachers Association increased member fees by $60, raising $50 million to fight Proposition 74.  The proposition failed, receiving 45% of the vote.    On July 24, 2009, President Barack Obama and Secretary of Education Arne Duncan announced the Race to the Top program which made available $4.35 billion in grants to ""encourage and reward States that are creating the conditions for education innovation and reform.  Requirements for states to receive funding from the new federal program include adopting policies that take into account student achievement when evaluating teachers and having plans to remove ""ineffective tenured and untenured teachers.   After failing to win Race from the Top funding, Colorado passed legislation in May of 2009 making it possible for teachers to lose their tenure status. Also in 2009, Ohio extended the period before a teacher becomes tenured from three years to seven.   Despite New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg favoring ""ending tenure as we know it, the United Federation of Teachers, with the largest political-action fund in New York City, has so far been able to protect tenure for teachers. New York is currently ineligible to receive Race to the Top funding because of an April 2008 law passed by the state legislature banning the use of student test data when making tenure decisions.

After the 2000 US presidential election's troubles with ""pregnant and ""hanging chads and the subsequent passage of the 2002 Help America Vote Act which swelled use of DREs, electronic voting technology became widely debated. Proponents argue that electronic voting machines are secure, able to unambiguously capture the intent of a voter, capable of preventing residual votes, reliable, easy to use, calculate and report voting results faster, and are accessible to disabled, illiterate, and non-English speaking voters. Opponents of electronic voting machines argue that DREs give too much power over public elections to their private manufacturers, are vulnerable to hacking and other forms of tampering, do not allow for meaningful audits and recounts, and do not offer voters a trustworthy way to verify their votes. ",Do Electronic Voting Machines Improve the Voting Process?,"The American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD), in its website section titled ""AAPD Policy Statement on Voter Verified Paper Ballots"" (accessed May 5, 2006), stated: ""AAPD and the disability community are in favor of a voter having the ability to verify the accuracy of their vote and to change any vote before their ballot is cast. In fact, it is one of the reasons the disability community has so strongly supported the implementation of DRE's."" May 5, 2006 - American Association of People with Disabilities (AAPD)"
